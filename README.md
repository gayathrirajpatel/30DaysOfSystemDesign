## System Design Fundamentals

### What is System Design?
System design is the process of defining the elements of a system, their interactions, and relationships to meet specific requirements. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller components and designing them to work together effectively to achieve the system's overall goal.

### How to Approach System Design?

1. **Understand the Problem:** Gather information about the problem, user needs, and system requirements. Identify constraints and limitations.

2. **Identify System Scope:** Define the system's boundaries, specifying what it will and will not do.

3. **Research Existing Systems:** Analyze similar systems, learning from successes and failures to inform your design decisions.

4. **Create a High-Level Design:** Outline the main components and their interactions. Use diagrams or flowcharts to visualize the system's architecture.

5. **Refine the Design:** Iteratively work on the details until you have a complete and detailed design meeting all requirements.

6. **Document the Design:** Create detailed documentation for future reference and maintenance.

7. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** System design is an ongoing process. Continuously monitor and improve the system to adapt to changing requirements.

### Performance vs Scalability

- **Performance:** Focuses on speed for a single user.
- **Scalability:** Focuses on maintaining speed under heavy load.
